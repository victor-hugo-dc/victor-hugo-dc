# Hi there, I'm Vic👋

I'm Victor Hugo, a software engineer based in Northern Virginia, currently modernizing tech infrastructure at Around Town Movers. As a former QuestBridge Scholar, I've interned at Microsoft and Snap, Inc., and contributed to research at Yale's Interactive Machines Group. While my core focus lies in backend development and cloud systems architecture, I'm excited by almost anything in tech.
